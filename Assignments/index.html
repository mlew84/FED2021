    <h1 id="About Me">About Me</h1>

    <P>I've always had a passion for computers since I was a kid. I didn't notice the love I had at first, I just remember being up all night with my friends trying to download as many songs and videos thru sites like Napster and Limewire.</P>

    <p>From that point on I wanted to know how was the software created and some of my favorite websites like NBA, ESPN, NFL, and hiphopdx.
    </p>

    <p>
        I would say being curious and wanting to change my career field is what brought me here to learn software development. I'm going to soak up all the information that is being provided and translating it into a bright future as a developer.
